This "Data" folder contains several brightfield Z-stacks for use with sephaCe.

Each folder contains the following:

- 3x "fine" images, which are in-focus and +/- 10um defocused (for boundary segmentation).
- 3x "init" images, which are in-focus and +/- 25um defocused (for initialisation).
- A "fl" DAPI-stained image for confirming location of the nucleus.

Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope with an automated stage and custom control software, owned and maintained by Boris Vojnovic's lab at the Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology, University of Oxford.
